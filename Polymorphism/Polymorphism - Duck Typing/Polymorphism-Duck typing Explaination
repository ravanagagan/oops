PolyMorphism
    Poly -> many
    Morph -> forms              One thing can take many forms

example:
        We behave differently in different location like with we behave differently with friends and we behave
        differently in office so we are polymorphic

* if we talk about objects, objects will have multiple forms

There are four ways of implementing Polymorphism
    1. Duck Typing
    2. Operator Overloading
    3. Method overloading
    4. Method overriding

Duck Typing:
    Duck test:
        if it looks like a duck,
        swims like a duck and
        quacks like a duck then it probably a duck

x = 5 -> 5 is a integer object, memory will be alloocated for that -> x is just a name for it
x = 'Gagan' -> 'Gagan' is a String object, memory will be alloocated for that -> x is just a name for it
note: We dont have specific type for X


No matter which class object this is what only matters is object, and object's class must contain the calling method
